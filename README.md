# C++ Module 08:

## Overview

In this module, we will explore **templated containers**, **iterators**, and **algorithms** in C++. These fundamental components are key to writing efficient and reusable code, enabling us to work with collections of data in a flexible and type-safe way. We’ll learn how C++’s Standard Library (STL) provides templated containers like `vector`, `list`, `map`, and others, how iterators allow us to traverse these containers, and how algorithms can be applied to them to perform operations like sorting, searching, and transforming data.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Introduction to Templated Containers**
- What **templated containers** are and how they enable flexibility by allowing storage of any data type.
- Overview of commonly used containers in C++: `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::deque`, `std::set`, `std::map`, and `std::unordered_map`.
- Differences between **sequential containers** (like `vector`, `list`) and **associative containers** (like `map`, `set`).
- How to define, initialize, and manipulate these containers in C++.
- **Memory management** in containers: Dynamic resizing in vectors, allocation strategies in lists, etc.

### 2. **Iterators in C++**
- What **iterators** are and why they are used to access elements in containers.
- How iterators provide a generic way of iterating through container elements, decoupling the data structure from the algorithm.
- Types of iterators: **Input iterators**, **Output iterators**, **Forward iterators**, **Bidirectional iterators**, and **Random-access iterators**.
- How to declare and use iterators with different containers, including `begin()`, `end()`, `rbegin()`, `rend()`, etc.
- Techniques for traversing containers with iterators and modifying data during iteration.

### 3. **STL Algorithms**
- Introduction to the powerful **STL algorithms** that can be used with any container that supports iterators.
- Common algorithms in C++: `std::sort()`, `std::find()`, `std::accumulate()`, `std::count()`, `std::reverse()`, `std::transform()`, and more.
- How to use algorithms with iterators to efficiently perform operations on containers.
- How to combine algorithms to solve complex problems with minimal code.
- How **lambda expressions** can be used with STL algorithms for custom operations.

### 4. **Custom Containers and Algorithms**
- Creating **custom templated containers** that mimic standard containers like `vector` or `list`.
- Implementing your own **iterators** for custom containers.
- Designing and implementing **algorithms** tailored to work with custom containers.

### 5. **Advanced Concepts**
- Understanding the trade-offs between different types of containers and iterators (e.g., `std::vector` vs `std::list`).
- The importance of **efficiency**: time complexity of different container operations and algorithmic considerations.
- **Algorithmic complexity** in C++ and how STL containers and algorithms handle different problem types (sorting, searching, etc.).
